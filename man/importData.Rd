\title{Import Term Document Matrix and Corpus Information}
\usage{
importData(
  tdm_file,
  corpus_file,
  sep_tdm = ";",
  sep_corpus_info = ";",
  zone = "stat",
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tdm_file}{Character. Path to the term-document matrix file (CSV or Excel).

tdm_file description:
\itemize{
\item The first column must contain the list of terms, while all other columns must be labeled with the corresponding years (or other time-points of reference).
}}

\item{corpus_file}{Character. Path to the corpus information file (CSV or Excel).

Corpus_file description:
\itemize{
\item The first column must contain the year (or other time-point).
\item The second column the total number of tokens per year.
\item The third column the number of documents per year.
\item The fourth column (if present) any additional metadata.
}}

\item{sep_tdm}{Character or NULL. Separator used in the TDM CSV file (e.g., "," or ";"). Ignored if the file is Excel.}

\item{sep_corpus_info}{Character or NULL. Separator used in the corpus information CSV file. Ignored if the file is Excel.}

\item{zone}{Character. Zone classification strategy to use. Either \code{"stat"} (default: statistical quartiles or balanced classes) or \code{"ling"} (linguistic frequency-based).}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE (default), the function prints progress messages. If FALSE, it operates silently.}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements:
\describe{
\item{tdm}{A tibble representing the cleaned and processed term-document matrix.
It contains the following columns:
\code{keyword} (the lexical unit or term),
\code{tot_freq} (total frequency of the term across all years),
\code{int_freq} (frequency interval string for the assigned zone),
\code{zone} (the assigned frequency zone),
plus one column per year representing term frequency in that year.}
\item{corpus_info}{A tibble with corpus-level yearly metadata.
It includes the columns:
\code{year} (observation year),
\code{dimCorpus} (total number of tokens),
\code{nDoc} (number of documents),
and optionally \code{metadata} (additional information).}
\item{norm}{Logical. Indicates whether the term-document matrix has been normalized (default is \code{FALSE}).}
\item{year_cols}{Numeric vector indicating which columns in the TDM refer to yearly frequencies.}
\item{zone}{Character vector of unique frequency zones used.}
\item{freq_int}{Character vector of unique frequency intervals used.}
\item{colors}{Character vector of default colors associated with zones.}
}
}
\description{
This function reads and processes a Term Document Matrix (TDM) and corpus information from CSV or Excel files.
It standardizes the format, renames columns, cleans keywords, computes total frequency per keyword,
and classifies terms into frequency zones. It also creates a column representing
the frequency interval associated with each zone.
