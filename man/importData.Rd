\title{Import Term Document Matrix and Corpus Information}
\usage{
importData(
  tdm_file,
  corpus_file,
  sep_tdm = NULL,
  sep_corpus_info = NULL,
  zone = "stat",
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tdm_file}{Character. Path to the term-document matrix file (CSV or Excel).

tdm_file description:
\tab The first column must contain the list of terms, while all other columns must be labeled with the corresponding years.}

\item{corpus_file}{Character. Path to the corpus information file (CSV or Excel).

corpus_file description:
\tab The first column must contain the list of years.
\tab The second column the total number of tokens per year.
\tab The third column the number of documents per year.
\tab The fourth column (if present) any additional metadata.}

\item{sep_tdm}{Character or NULL. Separator used in the TDM CSV file (e.g., "," or ";"). Ignored if the file is Excel.}

\item{sep_corpus_info}{Character or NULL. Separator used in the corpus information CSV file. Ignored if the file is Excel.}

\item{zone}{Character. Zone classification strategy to use. Either \code{"stat"} (default: statistical quartiles or balanced classes) or \code{"ling"} (linguistic frequency-based).}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE (default), the function prints progress messages. If FALSE, it operates silently.}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements:
\describe{
\item{tdm}{A tibble representing the cleaned and processed term-document matrix. Contains:
\itemize{
\item \code{keyword}: the lexical unit or term.
\item \code{tot_freq}: the total frequency of the term across all years.
\item \code{int_freq}: a string representation of the frequency interval for the assigned zone.
\item \code{zone}: the assigned frequency zone (e.g., \code{"VL"}, \code{"L"}, \code{"H"}, \code{"VH"} or \code{"low"}, \code{"medium"}, \code{"high"} depending on strategy).
\item Yearly frequency columns (one per year).
}}
\item{corpus_info}{A tibble containing corpus-level yearly metadata:
\itemize{
\item \code{years}: year of observation.
\item \code{dimCorpus}: total number of tokens.
\item \code{nDoc}: number of documents.
\item \code{metadata} (optional): additional information.
}}
\item{norm}{Logical. Indicates whether the term-document matrix has been normalized. Default is \code{FALSE}. If the TDM is normalized using the \code{normalize()} function, this will be set to \code{TRUE}.}
\item{year_cols}{A numeric vector indicating which columns in the TDM refer to yearly frequencies.}
\item{zone}{Character vector of unique frequency zones used.}
\item{colors}{Character vector of default colors associated with zones.}
}
}
\description{
This function reads and processes a Term Document Matrix (TDM) and corpus information from CSV or Excel files.
It standardizes the format, renames columns, cleans keywords, computes total frequency per keyword,
and classifies terms into frequency zones. It also creates a column representing
the frequency interval associated with each zone.
