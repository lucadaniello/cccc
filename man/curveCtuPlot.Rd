\title{Plot of Temporal Curves for Frequency Zones and Example Keywords}
\usage{
curveCtuPlot(
  data,
  ctu_noun = NULL,
  r = 1,
  themety = "light",
  size_class = NULL,
  x_lab = "year"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A list containing the output of \code{importData()}}

\item{ctu_noun}{Character vector of length 3. Specifies exactly three example keywords to highlight in the plot. Each keyword must be present in a different frequency zone (high, medium, low).}

\item{r}{Integer. Thinning rate for the x-axis labels; only one label every \code{r} years will be shown.}

\item{themety}{Character. Theme type, either \code{"light"} (default) or \code{"dark"}. This affects both plot aesthetics and color palettes.}

\item{size_class}{Optional numeric vector of length 3. Defines the line widths for the three zones (high, medium, low), respectively. If \code{NULL}, defaults are used based on the theme.}

\item{x_lab}{Character. Label for the x-axis. Defaults to \code{"year"}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object displaying keyword frequency trajectories over time,
with frequency zones visually distinguished by color and line thickness, and
the three specified keywords highlighted using a separate color legend.
}
\description{
This function generates a line plot of keyword frequency over time,
distinguishing between predefined frequency zones (high, medium, low)
and highlighting three example keywords with custom colors.
It supports both normalized and raw frequencies, and includes
customizable themes, axis labeling, and adaptive thinning of the x-axis labels.
}
\details{
The plot uses two separate color scales: one for
the frequency zones and one for the example keywords. Each zone is
labeled with its frequency interval,
and the example keywords are displayed with a distinct legend.
